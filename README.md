# ItemTemplate
Creating an item template maker for Game Developers in the blockchain space. 

## Updates:  


## Problem Statement:  

Blockchain has been lacking in the gaming space in the past years, due to no real success in games that incorporate the technology. Game developers are hesitant to try using blockchain because of multiple reasons, including not understanding what the technology can bring to the industry.

## Solution:  

This project aims to help game developers incorporate blockchain into their games by abstracting code to create NFTs. These NFTS will have meta data that will synergize with many different games, allowing the NFTs to be able to be used intermodally by players. 

## Dependencies:  

The project has many dependencies which it uses. Make your way to the root directory of the project, and use the terminal or other resources to install the dependencies. You can check to see if you have something installed by typing in the respective name and `--version`. Ex:  
`node --version`  

The steps below describe how to download the dependencies. Use the command which best suits your system.  
1. The first is node.js:
