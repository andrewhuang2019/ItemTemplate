# ItemTemplate
Creating an item template maker for Game Developers in the blockchain space. 

You can find the tutorial [here](QuickStart.md).  

## Updates:  
TBD:  
- Updating UI to look more presentable
- Adding other types of tokens (components and devTokens)  
- Updating Item Contract to allow players to mint NFTs  

## Problem Statement:  

Blockchain has been lacking in the gaming space in the past years, due to no real success in games that incorporate the technology. Game developers are hesitant to try using blockchain because of multiple reasons, including not understanding what the technology can bring to the industry.

## Solution:  

This project aims to help game developers incorporate blockchain into their games by abstracting code to create NFTs. These NFTS will have meta data that will synergize with many different games, allowing the NFTs to be able to be used intermodally by players.
